In order to comply with the ToS, pieces made by Avery have been removed. If you'd like to use these pieces, you will need to download and format them yourself.
I've also chosen to remove any pieces that were incomplete (i.e were missing a sprite or face piece where there should be one)

Pieces Formatted for use with SRD-Character Creator EX by Rhino

If you like what I'm doing, please give me a like on the forum! You can also send me a request to format some new pieces for you.
